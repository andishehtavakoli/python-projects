Best headphones for unbiased listening.","Great build quality, foldability, button features. Has truly got a 40hr battery backup, once you fully charge can work for a week. Dual pairing is one of its reckoning features. Good for calls, noise cancellation is excellent. The cloth near the ear piece is also of good quality. Using it for one year but the product is as new as bought recently. The size is on the ear and not over the ear. So it fits just on the ear. Outstanding performance.",Reviewed in India on 5 August 2024

Sound quality is good on wired mode but really bad on wireless mode.","Just after unboxing, I tested the headphone. On wireless mode, I didn't find the sound quality to be as great as I expected it to be. The noice cancellation was also not exceptional. The main problem was that when I plugged in the audio cable, I found out that the right earcup of the headphone was not working at all. It was because of loose-connection (inside headphones) somewhere I guess. I decided to give it some time before I tested it once again. This time, the wireless mode sound quality dropped significantly (On sharp beats, it started producing cracking sounds). This time on wired mode, both the earcups worked fine and the sound quality was really good. After 2-3 days of usage, cracking sound is still there on wireless mode. Overall I am not satisfied with these headphones. I would recommend not investing such an amount in JBL headphones but rather to go for budget earphones. I don't think JBL puts their best efforts in this price range. If you really want high quality, go for a high-price flagship model.",Reviewed in India on 4 August 2024

Sound quality is good on wired mode but really bad on wireless mode.","Just after unboxing, I tested the headphone. On wireless mode, I didn't find the sound quality to be as great as I expected it to be. The noice cancellation was also not exceptional. The main problem was that when I plugged in the audio cable, I found out that the right earcup of the headphone was not working at all. It was because of loose-connection (inside headphones) somewhere I guess. I decided to give it some time before I tested it once again. This time, the wireless mode sound quality dropped significantly (On sharp beats, it started producing cracking sounds). This time on wired mode, both the earcups worked fine and the sound quality was really good. After 2-3 days of usage, cracking sound is still there on wireless mode. Overall I am not satisfied with these headphones. I would recommend not investing such an amount in JBL headphones but rather to go for budget earphones. I don't think JBL puts their best efforts in this price range. If you really want high quality, go for a high-price flagship model.",Reviewed in India on 4 August 2024

Dual pairing is one of its reckoning features. Good for calls, noise cancellation is excellent. The cloth near the ear piece is also of good quality.

Best headphones for unbiased listening.","Great build quality, foldability, button features. Has truly got a 40hr battery backup, once you fully charge can work for a week. Dual pairing is one of its reckoning features. Good for calls, noise cancellation is excellent. The cloth near the ear piece is also of good quality. Using it for one year but the product is as new as bought recently. The size is on the ear and not over the ear. So it fits just on the ear. Outstanding performance.",Reviewed in India on 5 August 2024

Sound quality is good on wired mode but really bad on wireless mode.","Just after unboxing, I tested the headphone. On wireless mode, I didn't find the sound quality to be as great as I expected it to be. The noice cancellation was also not exceptional. The main problem was that when I plugged in the audio cable, I found out that the right earcup of the headphone was not working at all. It was because of loose-connection (inside headphones) somewhere I guess. I decided to give it some time before I tested it once again. This time, the wireless mode sound quality dropped significantly (On sharp beats, it started producing cracking sounds). This time on wired mode, both the earcups worked fine and the sound quality was really good. After 2-3 days of usage, cracking sound is still there on wireless mode. Overall I am not satisfied with these headphones. I would recommend not investing such an amount in JBL headphones but rather to go for budget earphones. I don't think JBL puts their best efforts in this price range. If you really want high quality, go for a high-price flagship model.",Reviewed in India on 4 August 2024
