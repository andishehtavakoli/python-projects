More specifically, he is interested in those aspects of knowledge representation that relate to commonsense reasoning, i.e., to the problem of finding suitable symbolic representation and efficient computer automation of human reasoning. The resolution of this problem is of fundamental importance to Artificial Intelligence, in particular, and to Computer Science as a whole. Specifically, much of his recent work was devoted to the issues of formalizing commonsense reasoning within the framework of logic programming and its extensions. Logic programming constitutes a relatively narrow domain of commonsense reasoning which is therefore easier to study and more efficient to implement. Consequently, logic programs provide fruitful test beds to study the highly complex issues involved in formalizing commonsense reasoning. The results of his studies led to the introduction of powerful extensions of the logic programming paradigm that allow much more expressive representation of commonsense knowledge.</p>

Ming&rsquo;s work has created computational tools that enable global visualization of unknown chemistry that makes it possible to rapidly discover new compounds. These approaches have further been scaled to enable repository scale analysis across all public metabolomics and natural products data. Ming has led the development of computational tools and infrastructure that resulted in the GNPS ecosystem &ndash; a web analysis and knowledge curation infrastructure that became the de facto standard tool for the natural products, metabolomics, and chemical ecology research communities. His computational tools are used by over 5K chemists and biologists from around the world each month. </span></span></span></p>

<p>My research interests lie in the intersection of dynamical systems, robotics, control and machine learning. Specifically, I seek to develop new mathematical and computational tools for resilient (semi-)autonomous robot navigation under uncertain and stochastic effects that arise naturally during robot deployment in real-world settings. Some representative areas of my research include modeling and control of nonlinear uncertain and stochastic systems, uncertainty quantification and probabilistic model validation, as well as motion planning, navigation and control of underactuated small-scale legged and aerial robots under uncertainty.</p>
